# Zonal Flows Project

Simulating and performing UQ on the zonal structures arising in plasma turbulence, specifically from magnetically confined plasma. For the full model we use the Hasegawa-Mima models (original and modified) which we treate pseudo-spectrally. We will use a triad model for the reduced model.
